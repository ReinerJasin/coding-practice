## Description
Complete the $solveMeFirst$ function with the following parameters:
* $int\ a$: the first value
* $int\ b$: the second value

Returns
- $int$: the sum of $a$ and $b$

---

## Examples
**Example 1**  
Input: <br/>
```
a = 2
b = 3
```

Output: <br/>
```
5
```

Explanation: <br/>
2 + 3 = 5

---

## Constraints
$1 \leq a, b \leq 1000$

---

## My Approach
Just follow the instruction in the code comment to `return a+b`.

---

## Complexity Analysis
* Time Complexity: O(1)
* Space Complexity: O(1)

---

## Implementation
* Language: Python
* See `solution.py` in this folder for the complete code.

---

## Performance (Optional)
* Runtime: NaN
* Memory: NaN

---

## Alternate Approaches (Optional)
List other ways you could have solved the problem:
* Nothing

---

## Lessons Learned (Optional)
The problem is just a simple addition problem of a + b. This is just an example problem to teach programmer how to do code in HackerRank and how to submit the code and automatically run the test cases.

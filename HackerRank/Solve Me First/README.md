## Problem Description
Complete the function $solveMeFirst$ to compute the sum of two integers.

---

## Function Description
Complete the $solveMeFirst$ function with the following parameters:
* $int\ a$: the first value
* $int\ b$: the second value

Returns
* $int$: the sum of $a$ and $b$

---

## Examples
**Example 1**  
Input: <br/>
```
a = 2
b = 3
```

Output: <br/>
```
5
```

Explanation: <br/>
2 + 3 = 5

---

## Constraints
$1 \leq a,\ b \leq 1000$

---

## My Approach
Just follow the instruction in the code comment to `return a+b`.

---

## Complexity Analysis
* Time Complexity: O(1)
* Space Complexity: O(1)

---

## Implementation

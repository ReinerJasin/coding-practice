## Problem Description
Alice and Bob each created one problem for HackerRank. A reviewer rates the two challenges, awarding points on a scale from 1 to 100 for three categories: problem clarity, originality, and difficulty.

The rating for Alice's challenge is the triplet a = (a[0], a[1], a[2]), and the rating for Bob's challenge is the triplet b = (b[0], b[1], b[2]).

The task is to calculate their comparison points by comparing each category:
* If a[i] > b[i], then Alice is awarded 1 point.
* If a[i] < b[i], then Bob is awarded 1 point.
* If a[i] = b[i], then neither person receives a point.

---

## Function Description
Complete the function compareTriplets with the following parameter(s):

* int a[3]: Alice's challenge rating
* int b[3]: Bob's challenge rating

Returns

* int[2]: the first element is Alice's score and the second is Bob's score

## Examples
**Example 1**  
Input: <br/>
```
5 6 7
3 6 10
```

Output: <br/>
```
1 1
```

Explanation:
* $a = (a[0],a[1],a[2]) = (5, 6, 7)$

* $b = (b[0],b[1],b[2]) = (3, 6, 10)$

Now let's compare each individual score:
* $a[0] > b[0]$, so Alice receives 1 point.

* $a[1] = b[1]$, so nobody receives a point.

* $a[2] < b[2]$, so Bob receives 1 point.

Alice's compraison score is 1, and Bob's comparison score is 1. Thus, we return the array [1, 1]

## Constraints
* $1 \leq a[i] \leq 100$
